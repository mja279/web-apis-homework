Challenges:

- I was NOT able to figure out how to subtract time from timer when an answer is wrong. 
- I was DID NOT have a chance to show when wrong answer is selected, change the color to red. 
- I was having trouble in storing the user inputted data. I tried to create a nested function, perhaps it is the
classes that are not set up correctly or that I'm trying to work with innerHTML and the way I'm trying to go about it is not the most efficient.
